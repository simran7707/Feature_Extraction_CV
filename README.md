# Feature_Extraction_CV

Feature extraction is crucial for many computer vision tasks such as object
recognition, image stitching, and tracking. The SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature
Transform) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithms are two widely
used methods for feature detection and description.

1. Implemented SIFT and ORB feature extraction on a set of given images.
2. Compared the keypoints detected by both algorithms, including the number of
keypoints, their distribution, and computational efficiency.
3. Used the extracted features to match keypoints between two images and
evaluate the performance of both algorithms. Discuss scenarios where one
method might outperform the other.
